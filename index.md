# Hi! Are you interested in meeting other civic tech nerds? You're in the right place. 

We are a group of technologists at all levels of government, contractors, and volunteers working with government to improve products and services for people. If you are in the Los Angeles area, we meet about every quarter to talk about all kinds of civic tech things like procurement, design, product management, open source code, and data science. We also really geek out over well designed forms! 

> Due to the wildfires early 2025, we will host our next meet up in the spring. Sending our love to all those whom were impacted :blue_heart:
