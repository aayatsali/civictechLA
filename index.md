# Hi! Are you interested in meeting other civic tech folks?

We are a group of technologists, based in the Los Angeles area, working at all levels of government as civic employees, contractors, and volunteers to improve products and services for people. We meet about every quarter to talk about all kinds of civic tech things like procurement, design, product management, open source code, and data science. We also really geek out over well designed forms! 

> Due to the wildfires early 2025, we will host our next meet up in the spring. Sending our love to all those impacted by the wildfires :blue_heart:
